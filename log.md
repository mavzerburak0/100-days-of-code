# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Signed up for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). 
* Opened a Twitter account to tweet my progress every day.

**Thoughts:** I am excited to start The Odin Project tomorrow. Although I think I have quite a bit of knowledge on foundations, I will still read through it and try to take it slow.

**Link to work:** None.

### Day 1: January 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 15% done on TOD Foundations Path.
* Created a simple HTML, CSS, JS website that generates a daily inspirational quote.

**Thoughts:** I had a productive day where I reviewed a bunch of foundational web development stuff on TOD. Since reading about coding doesn't count towards this challenge, I decided to build something simple with the knowledge that I already have from tinkering around previously. Overall, it took me about 3 hours to build a website using HTML, CSS and JS that generates an inspirational quote everyday (using a quotes API). It is pretty static but it helped me remember quite a lot and it was fun. I also quickly deployed it on heroku.

### Day 2: January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 25% done on TOD Foundations Path.
* Created a pomodoro application that also plays forest sounds.

**Thoughts:** I still haven't got to the part of TOD where I can start coding. That's why I decided to work on another simple project where I created a pomodoro application that counts down from 25 minutes plays forest sounds when a button is clicked. Also deployed it on heroku like yesterday. At first, I struggled online a bit with finding answers to my questions on how to implement a countdown function and the ones I found, I didn't quite understand. I ended up implementing my own short function. It may not be much to look at but it does the job, so I am happy with it.

### Day 3: January 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 40% done on TOD Foundations Path.
* Created a bouncing balls application following a tutorial from Mozilla.

**Thoughts:** Even though I couldn't quite understand how it all works at first, Firefox does a good job at explaining what each line of code does. This mini-project also made me aware of my lack of understanding of mathematics and how it could affect my coding. I think it would have taken me a great deal amount of time to come up with the solution. Regardless, I learned many new things about animation with JS.

### Day 4: January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 43% done on TOD Foundations Path.
* Finished Basic HTML and HTML 5 & Basic CSS courses on freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Today wasn't a very productive day coding-wise. Instead of creating a new project like I did for the last 3 days, I decided to spend it finishing interactive courses on freeCodeCamp. I learned new things about HTML and CSS that will be quite useful. Hoping to get back to simple coding projects tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished an HTML & CSS project "Tribute Page" for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** This project taught me about many HTML5 tags I haven't even heard of before like blockquote, cite etc. It was a fun and rather easy project but I am glad I at least got something done.

### Day 6: January 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 52% done on Applied Visual Design on freeCodeCamp.org
* Created a simple Sun, Earth and Moon animation following MDN tutorial

**Thoughts:** I would like to eventually improve on today's project to include all the members of the solar system. I learned a lot about CSS and color theory. It feels nice to be on track with this challenge seeing some people already giving up after 2-3 days.

### Day 7: January 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 75% done on Applied Visual Design on freeCodeCamp.org
* Started the 2nd project of Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Today wasn't the most productive as I was getting bored from all the details in the applied visual design course. I still managed to complete several more lessons but I feel like I don't quite read to understand. Most of the time I was just doing the task and skimming through reading part. Nevertheless, I managed to get started on the survey form project that I need to complete to get a responsive web design certificate.

### Day 8: January 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished Applied Visual Design on freeCodeCamp.org
* Practiced what I learned from Applied Visual Design to a simple drawing / animation project using HTML/CSS

**Thoughts:** I finally pulled through and finished the applied visual design course. At the end, it was fun and I came up with a simple project to use what I learned. I am happy with the things I learned, especially how powerful CSS is. The project can be improved to include an igloo and maybe a snowing effect. I hope to get back to it later.

### Day 9: January 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished Applied Accessibility on freeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts:** I didn't have much time today to practice a lot of coding (except when I code for work). However, I managed to finish the applied accessibility course on freeCodeCamp. I will try to find an interesting project for the weekend to practice on including some JavaScript. One important thing these courses taught me is that HTML and CSS has come a very long way. You can make very good-looking website without writing a line of JS.

### Day 10: January 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished Responsive Web Design Principles course on freeCodeCamp.org
* Improved on the Survey Form project

**Thoughts:** I know that it is important to learn about HTML and CSS, but I would like to already start playing with JS. Although I learn a lot during these courses, I just feel like it is not really coding since HTML and CSS are not programming languages. I am almost done with the Responsive Web Design certification path on freecodecamp and will get to finally continue The Odin Project soon.

### Day 11: January 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid courses on freeCodeCamp.org
* Submitted the first two (previously finished) projects for the certification
* Started the 3rd project on the list: Product Landing Page

**Thoughts:** I got a lot done today. First, finishing all the courses for Responsive Web Design certification and then creating the first two projects on codepen.io (initially they were only on my GitHub) and starting the 3rd project. I am not yet finished with the 3rd project but I plan on finishing it tomorrow to move on to 4th and 5th projects to get the certification. I feel like I have given too much of time and effort to not have something that shows my accomplishment. So I am determined to finish the whole course.

### Day 12: January 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Continued improving my 3rd project for Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts:** I thought I could finish the project today but because I felt really tired and unmotivated, I could only improve a few things here and there. But still I am happy that I at least worked on it even a little bit.

### Day 13: January 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished my 3rd project for freeCodeCamp RWD certification

**Thoughts:** I finally pulled through and finished the 3rd project for the Responsive Web Design certification. It is not perfect but it looks similar to the example page. I also discovered that I can write CSS and see the changes in real-time from developer tools in the browser. I am using live server in VSCode but I always have to switch back and forth to see the changes take effect. Also, I almost gave up today because I was getting bored with the project but I kept on and actually enjoyed the process. Deploying an app on Heroku after 2 not-very-productive days feels great.

### Day 14: January 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Made progress on my 4th project for freeCodeCamp RWD certification

**Thoughts:** I feel more comfortable working with CSS now that I can write it inside the browser and then copy and paste the changes whenever I make progress. Projects are coming along nicely. I deploy all of them to Heroku just to showcase it maybe someday.

### Day 15: January 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Added responsiveness to yesterday's project
* Started my 5th and final project for freeCodeCamp RWD certification

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy playing around with CSS and finding out more about what can be done with it. I think this has been the most productive and fun day overall. I started looking at what other people have been doing with HTML and CSS and copying it into my own websites and playing around to see how they actually work. Good thing is I understand why and how they use certain things. I plan on finishing my last project tomorrow and submitting all of them to get my certification.

### Day 16: January 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Improved on my 5th and final project for freeCodeCamp RWD certification

**Thoughts:** Working on my projects is becoming more and more enjoyable. I am currently creating my web development personal portfolio. I was able to make it fully responsive without the help of bootstrap or similar. I know that it is practical to use it and it would make my life much easier but this is a learning experience and I enjoy it more this way for now. I will most likely work with bootstrap in the future. Maybe I am getting too stuck with details, trying to make it perfect. I thought I could finish it today but there's still the contact section left. I will hopefully have more time tomorrow.

### Day 17: January 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished my 5th project
* Received Responsive Design Certification from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I finally finished the Responsive Web Design curriculum and received the certificate. I can say that I learned a ton about CSS. Also, it feels good to accomplish something. In the end, I am glad I kept going through the whole course instead of just skimming through the lessons and without completing any projects. I consider this my first big accomplishment out of this challenge. Tomorrow, I will keep working through The Odin Project.

### Day 18: January 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 53% done on The Odin Project Foundations Path
* Created a Google clone project

**Thoughts:** I am quite comfortable with CSS now. Although, positioning is sometimes bit of an issue. Adding responsiveness to my projects takes a bit more time than I think it should but still I am glad that I can do it without bootstrap or any other library. I am also happy to be back on track with TOD. I am not in rush to finish this path since it teaches valuable skills that will come in handy if I ever want to get a job in this field. I will take the time to finish and learn from the projects.
