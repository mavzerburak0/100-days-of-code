# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Signed up for The Odin Project[https://www.theodinproject.com]. 
* Opened a Twitter account to tweet my progress every day.

**Thoughts:** I am excited to start The Odin Project tomorrow. Although I think I have quite a bit of knowledge on foundations, I will still read through it and try to take it slow.

**Link to work:** None.

### Day 1: January 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 15% done on TOD Foundations Path.
* Created a simple HTML, CSS, JS website that generates a daily inspirational quote.

**Thoughts:** I had a productive day where I reviewed a bunch of foundational web development stuff on TOD. Since reading about coding doesn't count towards this challenge, I decided to build something simple with the knowledge that I already have from tinkering around previously. Overall, it took me about 3 hours to build a website using HTML, CSS and JS that generates an inspirational quote everyday (using a quotes API). It is pretty static but it helped me remember quite a lot and it was fun. I also quickly deployed it on heroku.

### Day 2: January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 25% done on TOD Foundations Path.
* Created a pomodoro application that also plays forest sounds.

**Thoughts:** I still haven't got to the part of TOD where I can start coding. That's why I decided to work on another simple project where I created a pomodoro application that counts down from 25 minutes plays forest sounds when a button is clicked. Also deployed it on heroku like yesterday. At first, I struggled online a bit with finding answers to my questions on how to implement a countdown function and the ones I found, I didn't quite understand. I ended up implementing my own short function. It may not be much to look at but it does the job, so I am happy with it.
