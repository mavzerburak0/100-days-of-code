# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* Signed up for The Odin Project[https://www.theodinproject.com]. 
* Opened a Twitter account to tweet my progress every day.

**Thoughts:** I am excited to start The Odin Project tomorrow. Although I think I have quite a bit of knowledge on foundations, I will still read through it and try to take it slow.

**Link to work:** None.

### Day 1: January 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* 15% done on TOD Foundations Path.
* Created a simple HTML, CSS, JS website that generates a daily inspirational quote.

**Thoughts:** I had a productive day where I reviewed a bunch of foundational web development stuff on TOD. Since reading about coding doesn't count towards this challenge, I decided to build something simple with the knowledge that I already have from tinkering around previously. Overall, it took me about 3 hours to build a website using HTML, CSS and JS that generates an inspirational quote everyday (using a quotes API). It is pretty static but it helped me remember quite a lot and it was fun. I also quickly deployed it on heroku.
